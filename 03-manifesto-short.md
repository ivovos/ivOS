# Manifesto (Short Version for Slides)

## Design is strategic from day one

Don't bolt it on at the end. Start with design to discover what problems are worth solving - through making, prototyping, testing with real people. Great products have a strong point of view on what the experience should feel like. That distinction is your competitive moat.

## Build for loyalty, not just attention

Design leadership creates retention - products people love and come back to. Build a culture that prototypes fast, tests constantly, ships interesting things at pace. More ideas in play, rigorous thinking about what works.

## Stay hands-on with new materials

AI has reopened everything. You can't lead strategy through abstract thinking alone. Build with it to understand where it breaks and what's actually possible. Player-coach leadership isn't optional right now - it's how you maintain relevant judgment.

## Ship to learn

Scope smaller, not lower quality. Do one thing brilliantly, get it out fast, find the people who love it, iterate with them. Speed to market with focus beats delayed perfection.
