# Design Leadership Manifesto (Condensed)

## Start with data, not screens
Prioritize understanding the data, tech, and use cases before designing any interface. That shapes real, viable solutions from the start—grounded in what’s possible and needed.

## Show, don’t tell
Build working prototypes early. Tangible demos beat documents for aligning teams and quickly learning what actually matters to users.

## Player-coach teams move faster
The best results come from tight, multidisciplinary teams with direct feedback loops. Hands-on leaders ensure rhythm and focus over coordination bloat.

## Strategy must stay visible
Shared goals and context are critical, even if the plan evolves. Everyone should know what we’re aiming for, and why it's the priority right now.

## Scope smaller, ship faster
Do one thing great, launch early, listen hard, iterate quickly. Real-world usage trumps endless internal refinements, especially with AI’s unpredictability.

## Know your material by building with it
Leading with new tech means prototyping constantly. By working with AI directly, we discover both its strengths and its sharp edges, staying ahead of the curve.

## The team culture must match the work
To build good products fast: you need leadership with product sense, a collaborative delivery team, and a culture of learning through building, not talking.
