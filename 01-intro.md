# Where I'm At

## I'm a strategic design leader who builds through making - especially with AI as the new material.

I've spent the last few years moving from agency conceptual work to actually shipping products that people use. Most recently at JAAQ, I led the launch of their mobile app and built Talk to JAAQ - an AI product that uses conversation to surface relevant human stories from their mental health content library. Before that I was at Normally, working on zero-to-one AI products for world leading companies like Apple, Spotify, Meta and IKEA. 

I care about using new technology to solve systemic problems that make people's everyday lives genuinely better - not just optimising attention economies. Right now, the material we're building with is wide open, and the only way to lead design strategy well is to stay hands-on. I prototype constantly to understand what's actually possible, then build the culture and conviction to ship things that matter.
