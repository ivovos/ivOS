### Critical Issues to Fix 🚩

#### 1. Timeline Confusion (Major Red Flag)
**Issue:**
- JAAQ: "2025 - Present" suggests you've only been there ~11 months max (if you started Jan 2025). This feels too short for a VP role to claim "led the launch" and multiple achievements

**Recruiter question:**
"Did you actually complete these projects or are they in progress?"

**Fix:**
Need specific dates (e.g., "Jan 2025 - Present") or reconsider how you frame achievements if you're still early in delivery

---

#### 2. Normally Tenure Needs Clarity
**Issue:**
- 10 years (2015-2025) in one role without title progression raises questions

**Recruiter question:**
"Why no promotion? Was this actually multiple roles? Is this a consulting shop where you worked on different projects?"

**Fix:**
Break this into phases or explain the progression. Show growth: "Design Director (2020-2025), Senior Designer (2015-2020)" or similar

---

#### 3. IKEA Home Services Date Mismatch
**Issue:**
- Key Projects said "(2014-2015)" but Experience section shows it under Normally (2015-2025)

**Recruiter question:**
"Which is it? This looks sloppy."

**Fix:**
Align the dates. If it was during Normally period, update Key Projects to reflect that
**Status:** FIXED - Key-Projects-Impact.md now shows correct dates

---

#### 4. Generic Descriptions Hurt You

**W12 Studios & IDEO sections are too vague:**
- "Led UX design for digital agency clients" - which clients? What outcomes?
- "Conducted user research and designed interactive experiences" - everyone says this

**Impact:**
Recruiter can't differentiate you from hundreds of other IDEO/agency alumni

**Fix:**
Add 1-2 specific, impressive projects or clients even if older work

**Meta contractor work is dismissive:**
- One line for Meta feels like you're hiding something or it didn't go well

**Recruiter question:**
"What actually happened here? Why so brief?"

**Fix:**
Add 2-3 bullets with actual work/impact, or if it was truly minor, consider removing it

---

#### 5. Education Incomplete
**Issue:**
- TU Eindhoven has no graduation year
- "Bachelor + Master" is unclear - did you do integrated program? Two separate degrees?

**Fix:**
Add graduation year and clarify the degree structure

---

#### 6. "Key Projects" Section is Redundant
**Issue:**
- Repeats what's already in Experience
- Takes up valuable space

**Fix:**
Either remove it entirely OR make it truly different (add visuals, metrics, links to case studies)
**Status:** FIXED - Moved to separate file Key-Projects-Impact.md

---

#### 7. Skills Section Too Generic
**Issue:**
- "Strategic product design, cross-functional alignment" - these are table stakes
- Missing: Specific tools (Figma, prototyping tools), frameworks (design thinking, lean), programming languages if applicable

**Recruiter question:**
"What can you actually DO on day one?"

**Fix:**
Add tactical skills that show you're hands-on

---

### Medium Concerns ⚠️

#### "What I'm Looking For" Section
**Pro:**
Shows self-awareness, filters out bad matches, saves everyone time

**Con:**
Some recruiters/companies will pass if you don't exactly fit, even if the role could be flexible

**Consideration:**
This is fine for targeted applications but might limit you for broad searches. Consider removing for general applications, keeping for specific targeted outreach

---

#### Summary Could Be Tighter
**Issue:**
Second paragraph is good but first sentence feels a bit buzzwordy

**Fix:**
Consider leading with the tactical value: "I combine 15+ years of design leadership with hands-on AI/ML prototyping to ship products that matter"

---

#### Missing Portfolio Link
**Issue:**
You have great visual work (screenshot you showed) but no website link

**Recruiter question:**
"Where can I see the work?"

**Fix:**
Add portfolio URL if you have one

---

### Format & Presentation ✓/⚠️

**Good:**
- Clean, scannable layout
- Appropriate length (not too long)
- Contact info clearly visible

**Could Improve:**
- Consider adding a "Tools & Technologies" subsection with specific tech stack
- Month/year format for recent roles would be clearer (e.g., "Jan 2025 - Present")

---

## Bottom Line: Would I Submit This?

**Current state:**
No, not yet. The timeline issues and vague sections would get questioned by hiring managers, making me look bad as a recruiter.

**After fixes:**
Yes, absolutely. You have an impressive profile - IDEO pedigree, €850M impact, AI/ML depth, and mission-driven work. With clearer timelines and more specific descriptions, this is a strong VP of Design/Head of Product Design candidate.

**Estimated level:**
This reads as Senior/Staff Designer trying to move into VP/Head of level, or early VP looking for next role. The JAAQ section will be critical - if you've truly shipped a product in <1 year that's impressive, but needs to be framed correctly.
