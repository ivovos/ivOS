# What Sets Me Apart

## 1. I Build to Understand, Not Plan to Execute

I don't strategy-deck my way through emerging technology. I prototype working solutions in hours or days to understand the material, then use that hands-on knowledge to make strategic decisions.

**Why this matters:** Most design leaders at VP/Director level have moved away from building. They rely on teams to explore whilst they stay at the strategy layer. I maintain technical proximity—I can prototype something working in 15 minutes, deploy a proper experiment in a day. This isn't about being hands-on for the sake of it; it's about maintaining relevant strategic judgement when the material is evolving this fast.

**Evidence:**
- **NHS (2023):** Built working AI research tool when AI was still uncertain territory. You can't understand this material through planning—you have to build with it. Now used by 100+ researchers.
- **IKEA:** Created functional prototypes customers could interact with using their own data, not strategy presentations. This approach secured €650M investment.
- **JAAQ:** Built product function from scratch in a media company—didn't just advise, built the v1.

## 2. I Ship Products That Actually Launch at Scale, Not Just Concepts

I have a track record of work that goes from prototype → pilot → market with major brands. Real products people can Google and buy, not case studies that never left the building.

**Why this matters:** Most design consultancy work never ships. Most internal design work gets killed in roadmaps. I have consistent evidence of shipped outcomes across 10 years with major brands—Spotify, IKEA, VW/Porsche, NHS England, JAAQ.

**Evidence:**
- **Spotify Car Thing (2022):** Launched as real hardware product
- **IKEA Preowned (2024):** Launched service, evolved from early circular economy work
- **VW/Porsche Cito (2024):** Launched mobility service
- **IKEA Home Manager AI:** €650M business in internal development
- **JAAQ mobile app:** Live in App Store (iOS + Android)
- **NHS AI tool:** Used by 100+ researchers, developed further internally

## 3. I Transform How Organisations Build, Not Just What They Build

I don't just deliver design work—I establish the delivery model, team structure, and platform thinking that creates leverage beyond any single project.

**Why this matters:** Most designers deliver features. I deliver systems—process transformation, platform architecture, and principles that guide future work. The lasting impact is transforming the foundation for how organisations build and ship product.

**Evidence:**
- **JAAQ:** Moved team from waterfall → autonomous 6-week cycles using Shape Up; transformed single app → platform architecture (Talk, Watch, Connect) supporting both consumer and enterprise products; established AI principles creating strategic clarity for all future AI work.
- **IKEA:** Multi-year programme management across research → prototype → pilot → investment phases; created entirely new business unit within IKEA; sustained delivery across multiple leadership changes.
- **Approach:** Player-coach model with small teams (3 people), weekly reviews, daily stand-ups—guiding through the work, not from a distance.

## 4. I Know When to Constrain AI, Not Just What It Can Do

My strategic insight with AI isn't "look what's possible"—it's defining what AI *shouldn't* do. I establish boundaries that maintain humanity whilst leveraging technology.

**Why this matters:** Everyone can prompt engineer. Few people have the judgement to say "AI should facilitate, not replace" in a product context and design accordingly. Strategic constraint (what AI shouldn't do) is as important as capability (what it could do). I understand AI's jagged capabilities through building with it, not through hype.

**Evidence:**
- **JAAQ Talk to JAAQ:** Kept AI in its lane—conversation and connection, not therapy or advice. Used AI for what it's good at (understanding context, making connections) then got out of the way and let real human experience do the work. Facilitated human connection rather than replacing it, surfacing authentic stories instead of AI-generated advice.
- **NHS (2023):** Kept researchers in the loop rather than trying to automate them away. AI summarised and surfaced patterns, but researchers maintained control over interpretation and synthesis. Built with users from day one.
- **Early adoption:** Both projects show hands-on AI work in 2023 when this was still uncertain territory, demonstrating early judgement that's now standard practice.

## 5. I Build Executive Trust Across Multi-Year Programmes That Survive Leadership Changes

I maintain client relationships and delivery across years, not just projects. My work evolves through research → prototype → pilot → investment phases with sustained executive confidence.

**Why this matters:** Most consultants get one shot, one project. I build relationships where clients come back year after year, investing more each time. Work survives leadership changes and becomes part of long-term roadmaps.

**Evidence:**
- **IKEA (2017-2025):** 8 years across Client Lead → Design Director roles
- **Multiple IKEA projects:** Circular economy work → IKEA Preowned (launched 2024); home data exploration → €650M AI business (2030 projection)
- **Programme management:** Multi-year, multi-project programme maintaining strategic alignment across IKEA's organisation whilst directing Normally's cross-disciplinary team through each phase
- **Sustained impact:** Work survived multiple IKEA leadership changes, secured €650M investment, became "critical part of their future roadmap"

## The Core Narrative

Most design leaders either stay strategic (losing technical proximity) or stay hands-on (losing business impact). I bridge both—building working prototypes to inform strategy whilst maintaining executive relationships that secure hundreds of millions in investment.

I don't just deliver features; I transform foundations—platform architecture, delivery models, AI principles—that create leverage beyond any single project. And my work consistently ships at scale with major brands, not just lives in case studies.

**For VP/Director roles:** Systems thinking + sustained client trust = leadership at scale. Strategic AI judgement through hands-on work, not abstraction.

**For fractional/consulting:** Multi-year trust + shipped outcomes = ROI evidence. Rapid prototyping + process transformation = speed + lasting change.
