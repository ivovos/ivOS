## Summary

I'm a strategic design leader who builds through making - especially with AI as the new material to open up new possibilities.

I've spent the last few years moving from agency conceptual work to actually shipping products that people use. I combine deep UX expertise and strong product sense with technical depth in AI/ML, allowing me to bridge strategic design thinking with what's technically possible. I thrive in player-coach roles where I can define product direction, design the first version, and align diverse stakeholders around a strategic roadmap.
