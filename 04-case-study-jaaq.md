# Case Study: JAAQ - Talk to JAAQ

## Project Overview
VP of Design role launching JAAQ's mobile app and creating an AI-powered mental health companion.

## The Problem
JAAQ had an incredible library of mental health content - compelling, honest conversations with celebrities and experts from sports, fashion, and music talking openly about their experiences. The content was valuable, but people couldn't find the specific insights relevant to their own situations. Navigation was impossible at scale.

## The Approach
- Built Talk to JAAQ - an AI conversation layer that lets people open up about their situation in a non-judgmental space
- Used AI to understand context and map user situations to relevant content
- Kept AI in its lane: conversation and connection, not therapy or advice
- Surfaced real human stories and experiences rather than AI-generated responses
- Led the iOS and Android app launch, getting all content onto mobile for the first time

## The Strategic Decision
Didn't try to make AI be the therapist. Used it for what it's good at (understanding context, making connections) then got out of the way and let real human experience do the work. Maintained humanity in an AI product.

## The Outcome
- Launched mobile app with full content library
- Created accessible pathway to relevant mental health content through conversation
- Demonstrated how AI can facilitate human connection rather than replace it

## What I Learned
The importance of keeping AI's role clear and bounded. The most powerful use wasn't generating advice, but making genuinely valuable human content discoverable and relevant to individual contexts.
