# Case Study: NHS - AI User Research Tool

## Project Overview
Early AI experimentation (2023) building research tools for NHS researchers, exploring how AI could support qualitative user research.

## The Problem
User researchers spend enormous time processing interviews, identifying patterns, and synthesising insights. Could AI help accelerate this whilst maintaining research quality? In 2023, this was still very uncertain territory.

## The Approach
- Built working AI research tool prototype for NHS
- Worked directly with researchers to understand their needs
- Tested and iterated with them throughout development
- Focused on AI as research assistant, not replacement
- Learned through building that you have to work with the material to understand it

## The Strategic Decision
Kept researchers in the loop rather than trying to automate them away. AI summarised and surfaced patterns, but researchers maintained control over interpretation and synthesis. Built with users from day one rather than building in isolation.

## The Key Learning
You can't understand this material through planning - you have to build with it. Doing user discovery *through* building the thing helped us understand both AI capabilities and researcher needs simultaneously. This shaped my entire approach to working with emerging technology.

## The Outcome
- **All 200 NHS researchers now using the tool**
- Developed further internally by NHS team
- Demonstrated early (2023) hands-on approach to AI that's now become standard practice
- Proved concept of AI-assisted research whilst maintaining research rigour

## What I Learned
The importance of building to understand new materials. You can't strategy your way through emerging technology - you have to get hands-on. Also learned that keeping humans in the loop isn't a compromise, it's often the better design.
