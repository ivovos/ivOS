### The Challenge

IKEA's Xplore group recognised the potential in customer and public data to address unmet home-related needs but struggled to turn these sources into services. As Client Lead, I needed to build and maintain an executive-level relationship whilst leading a design team to transform abstract data opportunities into a concrete, investable business proposition. The challenge was moving IKEA beyond furniture retail into data-driven home services—a completely new business model requiring research, rapid prototyping, customer validation, and ultimately securing €650M investment.

## SLIDE 3: Chapter 1 - Building Client Trust Through Prototypes

**[LARGE VISUAL: Working prototypes showing home data in action]**
- Functional AI interface customers could interact with
- Real data demonstrations
- Cross-disciplinary team at work

**Chapter 1: From Abstract Opportunity to Working Prototypes**

As Client Lead, I established the executive relationship with IKEA's Xplore group and built confidence in Normally's approach. Rather than presenting strategy decks, I led a cross-disciplinary team to rapidly create functional prototypes that customers could interact with using their own data. This approach allowed us to quickly test and validate propositions with real customers, helping IKEA identify the most promising home services. The working prototypes—built using Normally's suite of data and AI tools—demonstrated what was possible before significant investment, creating conviction around a long-term bet.

## SLIDE 4: Chapter 2 - Designing the Home Manager Platform

**[LARGE VISUAL: Suite of AI-enabled home services]**
- "How can I reduce my energy bills?" with solar panel recommendations
- "I've broken a window, am I covered?" insurance integration
- "How can I make my home child friendly?" product recommendations
- URL for every home showing personalised data

**Chapter 2: A Suite of AI-Enabled Home Services**

I led the design vision for IKEA's home service platform, creating a suite of AI-enabled services that expanded IKEA's offerings beyond furniture. The strategic insight was giving each home a unique URL where residents could access regional, property, and household data—unlocking enormous business potential. Services ranged from energy efficiency recommendations and insurance enquiries to child-proofing suggestions, all powered by AI that understood context and connected IKEA's products to real home needs. Rather than just adding smart home features, we leveraged IKEA's unique position—furnishing homes, understanding space, commitment to sustainability—to create genuinely new value.

**Chapter 3: Client Leadership at Scale**

As Client Lead and later Design Director, I managed an 8-year, multi-project programme with IKEA. I built executive-level relationships that enabled work to evolve from initial research through multiple prototypes to market-scale pilots—maintaining strategic alignment across IKEA's organisation whilst directing Normally's cross-disciplinary team through each phase.

### Outcomes

**Business Impact:** €650M projected ARR by 2030, entirely new business unit created within IKEA, platform currently in internal development and critical part of their future roadmap.

**Design Strategy:** Led cross-disciplinary team to create functional, scalable prototypes that validated business model with real customers before major investment—show don't tell at hundreds of millions scale.

**Sustained Delivery:** Multi-year programme spanning research, prototyping, pilot, and investment phases. Work survived multiple IKEA leadership changes, demonstrating sustained executive trust.

### Key Learning

The lasting impact came from combining client relationship management with design leadership. By maintaining executive-level trust whilst directing a team to rapidly prototype and validate with customers, I helped IKEA make a €650M bet on a completely new business model. Strategic design work influences at massive scale when you show, don't tell—building working prototypes early enough shaped investment decisions worth hundreds of millions.
