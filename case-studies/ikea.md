# Case Study: IKEA - Home Interface & Sustainability

## Project Overview
Early strategic work reimagining IKEA as the central interface to the home, exploring new services and sustainable home management.

## The Problem
IKEA had opportunity to move beyond furniture retail into home services, but needed to understand what role they could play in people's relationship with their homes. How could IKEA become relevant in new ways? What services could they provide that align with their sustainability mission?

## The Approach
- Early exploration of IKEA as central home interface
- Built agent systems and tools that aggregate information from different sources
- Created prototypes showing how IKEA could help people make their homes more sustainable
- Demonstrated new service models through working examples
- Focused on home data and insights as a strategic capability

## The Strategic Decision
Rather than just adding smart home features, we explored how IKEA's unique position (furnishing homes, understanding space, commitment to sustainability) could create genuinely new value. Used prototypes to build conviction around a long-term bet.

## The Outcome
- **€850 million investment** in home data and services
- Created entirely new home data team to develop the vision
- Grew IKEA's exploration team from 5 to 30 people
- Established strategic direction that's still being developed and brought to market

## What I Learned
Strategic design work can influence at massive scale when you show, don't tell. Built working prototypes early enough to shape investment decisions worth hundreds of millions. The long timeline from prototype to market reality in large organisations.
