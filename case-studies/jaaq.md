### The Challenge

When I joined JAAQ, the company had a rich mental health video library—authentic conversations with experts and celebrities—but users couldn't find content relevant to their specific situations. The challenge was twofold: connecting broad mental health content to individuals with unique needs, and building a product function from scratch in a media company with no existing product capability. Additionally, the foundation needed to support both consumer and enterprise customers from day one.

## SLIDE 3: Chapter 1 - Mobile Foundation

**[LARGE VISUAL: Mobile app screens showing content library]**
- iOS and Android app interfaces
- Video library browsing experience
- Content organized and accessible

**Chapter 1: Mobile Foundation**

Led design and launch of JAAQ's first mobile app (iOS and Android) in partnership with Product and Engineering. I brought the full mental health video library to mobile for the first time, designing browsing, discovery, and viewing experiences for a mobile-first audience while shipping both platforms simultaneously. This established JAAQ's mobile presence and created the foundation for all future mobile features.

## SLIDE 4: Chapter 2 - AI Layer (Talk to JAAQ)

**[LARGE VISUAL: Talk to JAAQ conversation interface]**
- Show conversation flow: user input → AI response → video surfaced
- Ideally animated GIF or sequence showing the interaction
- Highlight the moment of connection (conversation → relevant content)

**Chapter 2: AI Conversation Layer**

I designed Talk to JAAQ Beta—an AI-powered conversation layer that personalises content discovery while preserving JAAQ's authentic human storytelling. The strategic decision was to keep AI in its lane: conversation and connection, not therapy or advice. I used AI for what it's good at (understanding context, making connections) then got out of the way and let real human experience do the work—facilitating human connection rather than replacing it, surfacing authentic stories instead of AI-generated advice.

### Transforming How JAAQ Ships Product

I established autonomous delivery cycles using Shape Up methodology, moving the team from waterfall to shipping independently in 6-week cycles. This transformed team dynamics from waiting for direction to owning decisions and outcomes—resulting in faster iteration and genuine team autonomy.

### From Single App to Platform Architecture

I defined a platform approach with shared components (Talk, Watch, Connect) that power multiple product experiences from a single codebase. This architecture enables both consumer and enterprise products, creating faster time-to-market for new experiences and establishing the foundation for JAAQ's B2B expansion beyond the D2C app. Rather than just shipping features, I transformed the foundation—the delivery model, platform architecture, and AI principles create leverage beyond any single product.

### Outcomes

**Shipped Product:** Mobile app launched and live (iOS + Android), Talk to JAAQ Beta in users' hands, and full content library accessible on mobile.

**Team Transformation:** Team shipping independently in 6-week cycles with autonomous decision-making and faster iteration.

**Platform Foundation:** Shared component architecture (Talk, Watch, Connect) supporting both consumer and enterprise products, establishing the foundation for B2B expansion.

**AI Principles Established:** Clear boundaries for AI's role (facilitate, don't replace), creating a model for responsible AI in sensitive contexts while maintaining humanity within the technology.

### Key Learning

**VP-Level Impact = Building the System**

The lasting impact wasn't any single feature—it was transforming the foundation for how JAAQ builds and ships product.

**Three Levels of Transformation:**
1. **Product:** Platform thinking enables future products beyond the first app
2. **Process:** Autonomous teams ship faster and take ownership
3. **Principles:** AI boundaries create strategic clarity for all future AI work

**The Core Insight**
The most powerful AI use wasn't generating advice—it was making genuinely valuable human content discoverable and relevant to individual contexts. Strategic constraint (what AI shouldn't do) was as important as capability (what it could do).

## Visual Assets Needed

**For this case study, you'll need:**

1. **Slide 1 (Hero):**
   - Mobile app hero shot (both apps, professional)
   - Or: Before/After comparison

2. **Slide 2 (Challenge):**
   - Old web interface or content overload illustration

3. **Slide 3 (Mobile Foundation):**
   - 3-5 key app screens showing navigation, library, video player

4. **Slide 4 (Talk to JAAQ):**
   - Conversation interface screenshots or GIF
   - User journey showing conversation → discovery

5. **Slide 5 (System):**
   - Shape Up cycle diagram
   - Platform architecture diagram (Talk, Watch, Connect)

6. **Slide 6 (Outcomes):**
   - App Store screenshots (proof it shipped)
   - Team process photos (optional)

**Video (30-60 seconds):**
Screen recording showing: User opens Talk to JAAQ → has conversation → AI surfaces relevant video → user watches authentic story
