# Portfolio Structure

## Recommended Deck Flow

### 1. Introduction (1 slide)
- Where I'm at headline + paragraph
- Sets context for who you are and what you care about
- Source: `01-intro.md`

### 2. Case Studies (3-4 slides, one per project)
Each slide should include:
- Project name and one-line description
- The problem (2-3 sentences)
- Your approach (3-4 bullet points)
- The outcome (with metrics where possible)
- Embedded video or link (30-60 seconds)

**Project order:**
1. Jack (shipped consumer product)
2. IKEA (strategic influence at scale)
3. NHS (early AI adoption, now in use)

Source files:
- `04-case-study-jack.md`
- `05-case-study-ikea.md`
- `06-case-study-nhs.md`

### 3. Manifesto (1-2 slides)
- Use short version for maximum impact
- Consider visual hierarchy: bold the headlines
- Source: `03-manifesto-short.md`

### 4. What I Need (optional, can be part of manifesto slide)
- Quick bullets on working conditions
- From the "What I need to work well" section in `02-manifesto-full.md`

## Design Notes

**Keep it scannable:**
- No dense paragraphs
- Bold key metrics and outcomes
- One compelling image per case study
- Videos do the heavy lifting

**Format:**
- Export as PDF for easy sharing
- Keep file size reasonable (<10MB with videos)
- Ensure videos play in PDF or provide links

**Tone:**
- Confident and specific
- Evidence-based (metrics matter)
- Honest about what's shipped vs. in development
- Shows strategic thinking through concrete examples

## Video Requirements

Each case study needs a 30-60 second video showing:
- **Jack:** User conversation → AI response → video surfaced
- **IKEA:** Home data → sustainability insights → recommendations
- **NHS:** Interview processing → pattern identification → researcher workflow

Use Screen Studio or ScreenFlow to record.
No audio needed - just show the product working.
Export at 1080p, reasonable file size.
