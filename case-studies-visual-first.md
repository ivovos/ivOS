# Case Studies – Visual-First (Show, Don’t Tell)

## JAAQ – Talk to JAAQ

**Hero Visual:**
- App interaction GIF or screenshot showing AI surfacing a relevant video (core user flow)

**Punchline:**
Empowering users to quickly find the right mental health story through AI conversation.

### Problem
- Users couldn’t find the content relevant to their situation—navigation was impossible at scale.

### Approach
- Built an AI conversation layer to guide users to the right stories
- Prioritized surfacing genuine human experiences, not therapy

### Outcome
- Mobile app launched with full content library
- Users connect to relevant stories via conversation, not menus

### Key Learning
The strongest use for AI here was making valuable human content discoverable, not replacing real experience or advice.

## IKEA – Home Interface & Sustainability

**Hero Visual:**
- Prototype or concept image: central home dashboard, sustainability insights delivered to the user, or investment headline visual

**Punchline:**
Reimagined IKEA as the home’s digital interface—moving from retail to actionable sustainability services.

### Problem
- Needed a clear value proposition and new ways to serve as a sustainability-driven home hub.

### Approach
- Built working service prototypes and agent systems aggregating home data
- Used prototypes to align leadership and drive large-scale investment

### Outcome
- €850M invested, new teams created, and a roadmap set for home data & sustainability

### Key Learning
Early, tangible prototypes were critical in shaping strategic investment—‘show, don’t tell’ works at massive scale.

## NHS – AI User Research Tool

**Hero Visual:**
- Screencast: AI-processed interview with pattern identification, or workflow storyboard

**Punchline:**
Accelerated qualitative research by putting AI in researchers’ hands—not in place of them.

### Problem
- Researchers bogged down in manual interview synthesis—AI’s potential was unproven and risky.

### Approach
- Built and iterated research tools directly with NHS users; AI acted as assistant, not replacement

### Outcome
- Every NHS researcher using the tool, in-house development ongoing, proof of AI-assisted rigorous research

### Key Learning
Discovery through building: you can’t plan your way through emerging tech—hands-on experimentation surfaced true opportunities and boundaries.
