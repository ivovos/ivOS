# What I'm Looking For

I'm seeking senior design leadership opportunities in the **player-coach model**—roles where I can be hands-on with strategic product design while leading cross-functional alignment across product, engineering, marketing, and business teams.

## The Role

I thrive when I can define product direction, design the first version, and then align diverse stakeholders around a strategic roadmap. I'm looking for positions where I can both execute on strategic design work and lead teams through the complexities of building innovative products.

## Product & Mission

I'm most interested in **B2C consumer products** and select B2B opportunities with companies building products that create genuine positive impact:

**Core focus areas:**
- Mental health, wellbeing, and healthcare accessibility
- Climate action and sustainability (energy, circular economy, sustainable systems)
- Future of work (human-centered tools, accessibility, worker empowerment)
- Housing and urban development (affordable housing, sustainable cities)

**Broader mission lens:**
Products that make essentials more accessible, reduce inequality, improve quality of life, or protect the environment. Open to both B2C and B2B where the purpose is clear and impact is tangible.

**Not interested in:** Ad-tech, gambling, crypto speculation, or pure entertainment/social media

I've worked with organizations like mental health platforms, IKEA's sustainability initiatives, and NHS healthcare—and I'm drawn to similar mission-driven work.

## What I Bring

I combine deep UX expertise and strong product sense with technical depth in AI/ML. I understand how AI works in detail—the latest tools, agent frameworks, development approaches, and real-world limitations. This allows me to bridge strategic design thinking with what's technically possible, helping teams build products that leverage new technology to solve genuine user problems.

I also bring cross-functional leadership experience, aligning diverse groups and building consensus on prioritization and strategic direction.

## Ideal Environment

Teams building with cutting-edge technology (especially AI) where strategic vision meets hands-on execution, and where my ability to align stakeholders can help drive meaningful impact.
