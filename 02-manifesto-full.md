# Design Leadership Manifesto

## Design starts with data structure, not interfaces

Most designers start with screens. I start with understanding the data structure and tech stack with developers. This creates a shared language and ensures the logic actually works before you design a single pixel. Knowing what data you have access to, how it's stored, and what's technically possible isn't a detail - it's foundational. Design the data structure first, then design the experience around what's real.

## Show, don't tell

Always be creating the thing that brings the vision to life, then get the data to back it up. Prototypes beat decks. Working code beats strategy documents. Build something people can experience, test it with real users immediately (especially for AI products), and let actual usage guide decisions. The faster you get from idea to tangible thing, the faster you learn what actually matters.

## Player-coach means small teams with rhythm

Small teams of three: strategic person, designer, delivery driver. Weekly reviews, daily stand-ups on everything. You guide through the work, not from a distance. This isn't about being involved in everything - it's about maintaining the feedback loop between strategy and execution. When teams grow beyond this, you lose the tight collaboration that lets you move fast and stay coherent.

## Strategy clarity is non-negotiable

No business strategy means no product strategy, which means no roadmap, which means chaos. Someone needs to hold and communicate the strategy, even if it's evolving. Alignment between main stakeholders on goals is everything. Without this, you're just building features in a vacuum. Even in early-stage work, create a dummy roadmap to manage expectations - lack of visible direction makes people unhappy and unproductive.

## Scope smaller, ship faster, iterate with users

Do one specific thing brilliantly rather than everything adequately. Get it out fast, find the people who love it, iterate with them. For AI products especially, get users involved immediately and dig deep into their feedback and evaluations. Real usage teaches you more than any amount of internal refinement. Hold the larger vision whilst being ruthless about initial scope.

## Understanding your material means building with it

AI has reopened everything we thought we knew. The capabilities are jagged and unpredictable. You can't lead design strategy through abstract thinking - you have to build with it constantly to understand where it breaks and what's actually possible. I can prototype something working in 15 minutes, deploy a proper experiment in a day. This hands-on work isn't a nice-to-have, it's how you maintain relevant strategic judgment when the material is evolving this fast.

## What I need to work well

Leadership with genuine product sense - people who understand what it takes to build products, not just market them. A capable delivery team that works collaboratively as one unit, not in waterfall handoffs. Clear business strategy at the top level that lets us align on goals and build a coherent product roadmap. Small team structures where I can stay close to the work. And a culture where we create clarity by building things, not talking about them.
